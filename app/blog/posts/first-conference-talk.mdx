Well folks, it is truly humbling to hear yourself talk, but I figured I should post it anyway. I made all sorts of rookie mistakes, including reading directly from the slides. But hey, for posterity and honesty, I'm just going to get over all that lingering embarrassment and post it anyway:

In the talk, I discuss my journey from working in lumber to going to a dev bootcamp and becoming a junior dev. It's a fun bit of personal history with some insight into how the process worked for me and could potentially work for you.
